# Episode 10 : Closures in JS

### Important Interview Question

**Closure :** Function bundled together with its lexical environment/scope. //Function along with its lexical scope forms a closure.

```
//Example 1

function x(){
  var a = 7;
  function y(){
    console.log(a);
  }
  y();
}

x();
```
```
//Example 2 - Assigning entire function to a variable

function x(){
  var a = function y(){
    console.log(a);
  };
  
  y();
}

x();
```
```
//Example 3 - Passing an entire function as a parameter inside another function

function x(){
  var a = 7;
  
  y();
}

x(function y(){
    console.log(a);
  });
```
```
//Example 4 - return a function from a function

function x(){
  var a = 7;
  function y(){
    console.log(a);
  }
  return y;
}

x();
```
```
//Example 5 - extension of Example 4

function x(){
  var a = 7;
  function y(){
    console.log(a);
  }
  return y;
}

//console.log(z);
var z = x();
console.log(z);
```
-----------------------
When functions are returned from another fun, they still maintain their lexical
scope.
 ```
 //Example 6
 
function x(){
  var a = 7;
  function y(){
    console.log(a);
  }
  return y; //line 6
}

var z = x(); //line 9
console.log(z);
//....................after 1000 lines of code
z(); //line XXD
```
- When y is returned, not only is the function returned but the entire closure (func. y + its lexical scope) is returned and put inside z. Basically at line 5 not just y function was returned but at line 5 the y function along with the lexical scope of y function was returned. Therefore as lexical scope is returned that is why when z is used somewhere else in program like line XXD, it still remembers var a inside x() //so even though after line 9 evn though x() function or x EC no longer exists in the memory but the y() function still remembers its lexical scope/environment or basically where it came from 
- So even though the x function is lost or no longer accessible after line 9, the y function still has a strong binding with its parent x function. This is because the y function is a closure. A closure is a function that has access to the variables of its enclosing scope, even after the enclosing scope has been closed.
- Closure is a very powerful concept of JS, just because this function remembers things even if they are not in their lexical scope

 ```
 //Example 7 - same just another way of writing Example 6
 
function x(){
  var a = 7;
  return function y(){
    console.log(a);
  }
}

var z = x(); 
console.log(z);
//....................after 1000 lines of code
z(); //line XXD
```
### Corner Cases (JS Closure GOTCHAs)
```
//Example 8

function x(){
  var a = 7;
  function y(){
    console.log(a);
  }
  a = 100;
  return y;
}
//console.log(z);
var z = x();
console.log(z);
z();
```
```
//Example 9

function z() {
  var b = 900; 
  function x(){
    var a = 7;
    function y(){
      //var a = 22;
      console.log(a,b);
      //var a = 22;
    }
    y();
  }
  x();
}
z();
```

### Uses of Closure

- Module Design Pattern,
-  Currying, 
-  Functions like once(fun that can be run only once), 
-  memoize, 
-  maintaining state in async world, 
-  setTimeout, 
-  iterators 
-  and many more...
