# Episode 7 : Scope and Lexical Environment

```
(Case-1)

function a() {
//var b = 25;

    console.log(b); // surprisingly instead of printing not defined it prints 10. 
    //So somehow this b(present in local EC) could access the b outside the func.(present in GEC) 
}

var b = 10;
a();
```
> 10
---------------------
```
Another case: (Case-2)

function a() {
  c();
  function c() {
  console.log(b); // when cursor comes here, it still prints out 10 somehow!!
  }
 }
 var b = 10;
 a();
 
 //var b = 44;
 //console.log(b); 
 ```
 > 10
 --------------------
 ```
 Another one (DJ KHALED!) (Case-3)
 
 function a() {
  var b = 10;
  c();
  function c() {
    console.log("andar wala b - " + b); //it prints the right value. How? See ans below Summary part
  }
 }
 
 a();
 console.log(b); // now when cursor comes here, it prints NOT DEFINED!
```
> 10 <br/>
> b is not defined
 --------------------
- This is the intuition behind **scope**
- Scope is directly dependent on the lexical environment
- **Lexical Environment : local memory + lexical env of its parent**; so suppose c is a function inside function a and a is a function inside GEC, so lexical environment of c = total memory of c =  local memory of c  + reference to the lexical environment of parent a and lexical environment of a = total memory of a = local memory of a + reference to the lexical environment of parent GEC
- Whenever an EC is created, a Lexical environment(LE) is also created and is referenced in the local EC(in memory space)
- Lexical means hierarchy. In the DJ KHALED (xD) code, function c is lexically inside function a, or in other words c is physically present inside a so - a is the lexical parent of c/ c's lexical parent is a
- So in EC of c() in the memory column- variables and func. in c (none) + reference of lexical env of parent a() is there 
i.e ***total memory of func. c = local memory of c (variables and func. in c (none)) + {reference of lexical env of parent of c == LE of a() }***
- LE of a() in turn is its memory space + reference to LE of parent (Global EC) i.e ***LE of a() = local memory of a (variables and func. in a) + {reference to LE of parent of a == LE of (Global EC) }***
- LE of (Global EC) in turn is its memory space + reference to LE of parent of Global EC i.e ***LE of parent (Global EC) = local memory of (Global EC) + reference to LE of parent of GEC***
- LE of parent of GEC is/points to *null*   //because (Global EC) has no parent
 ```
    To summarize the above points:
    
    call_stack = [GEC, a(), c()]

    Now lets also assign the memory sections of each execution context in call_stack.

    c() = [[lexical environment pointer pointing to a()]]

    a() = [b:10, c:{}, [lexical environment pointer pointing to GEC]]

    GEC =  [a:{},[lexical_environment pointer pointing to null]]
 ```
  ### For Case-3 
  - First JS engine searches for b in local mem of c(). Nothing is there. 
  - So it goes to the reference of Lexical env of parent a(). Here b = 10 is here. So it takes this value, goes back to c() and console prints it.
  - Had b not been in a(), then pointer would have gone to a()'s parent (Global EC and searched there). Had b not been there too, then it goes to LE of global's parent
  which is null. Now JS engine stops and says b is NOT DEFINED. 
  - **Lexical env of c = Local memory of c + LE of A + LE of Global**
  - The chain of all the Lexical Environments is known as the **scope chain** and it defines whether a variable or function is present inside the scope or not (If the scope chain is exhausted and the variable is not found that means the variable  is not present inside the scope chain) / This process of going one by one to parent and checking is called **scope chain**
 --------------------
```
  Another Trial Example
 
function a() {
  var b = 2;
  c();

  function c() {
    //var b = 3;
  console.log(b);
  }
 }

 var b = 1;
 a();
```
> 2
