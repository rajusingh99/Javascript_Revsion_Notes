# Episode 9 : Block Scope and Shadowing

### What is a block?
- Block a.k.a *compound statement* is used to group JS statements together into 1 group. We group them within {...}
- Why do we need to group all the statements together? - The purpose of grouping all the statements together in a block is so that we can use multiple statements in a place where JS expects only 1 statement.

```
//code example 1

if(true)some statement
```

But if we want to write more statements to execute after if condition; then:

```
//code example 2

if(true){
    statement 1
    statement 2
    ...
}
```

* The {} block treats all the statements as one statement.
* The if doesnt have any curly braces in syntax.

### __BLOCK SCOPE__

* What are the variables and functions that can be accessed inside the block.

```
//code example 3

{
    var a = 10;
    let b = 20;
    const c = 30;
} //line 5

console.log(a);
console.log(b);
```

Outputs:

> 10

> Uncaught ReferenceError: b is not defined

* Behind the Scenes:

    * In the BLOCK SCOPE; we get b and c inside it initialized as *undefined* as a part of hoisting (in a seperate memory space called block)
    * While, a is stored inside a GLOBAL scope. 

* Thus we say, *let* and *const* are BLOCK SCOPED. They are stored in a separate mem space which is reserved for this block. Also, they can't be accessed outside this block.
But var a can be accessed anywhere as it is in global scope.
* Thus, we can't access them outside the Block. (//after executing it reaches line 5 and now after line 5 variables b and c are no longer accessible as after line 5, the block is finished and *let* and *const* are not accessible outside the block)
* Hence, **Variables declared with *let* and *const* are not accessible outside the block in which they are declared. This is called block scope**. 
* But observe we can access var a even outside the block (i.e even after line 5) because var is in the global scope or attactched to the global object (here global object is window). Hence, **Variables declared with var are globally scoped, which means that they can be accessed from anywhere in the JS program**.

```
//code example 4

{
  var a = 10;
  let b = 20;
  const c = 30;

  console.log(a);
  console.log(b);
  console.log(c);
}

  console.log(a);
  console.log(b); //error- will not print as b cannot be accessed out of block, so program will come and stop at this line
  console.log(c); //error- will not print as c cannot be accessed out of block
  
```
Outputs:

> 10

> 20

> 30

> 10

>  Uncaught ReferenceError: b is not defined

### __What is SHADOWING in JS?__

```
//code example 5

var a = 100; //pehlaA
{
    var a = 10; //same name as global var a //dusraA
    let b = 20;
    const c = 30;
    console.log(a); // 10 //dusraA variable a shadows pehlaA variale a so 10 gets printed
    console.log(b); // 20
    console.log(c); // 30 
}

console.log(a); // 10 instead of the 100 we were expecting.So apart from "dusraA variable a shadows pehlaA variale a so 10 gets printed", dusraA also modified the existing pehlaA value of variable a , basiaclly block "a" modified val of global "a" as well
// In console, only b and c are in block space. a initially is in global space(a = 100), and when a = 10 line is run, a is not created in block space, but replaces 100 with 10 in global space itself. 
```

* If one has same named variable outside the block, the variable inside the block *shadows* the outside variable.
* So, a is reassigned to 10. Since both refers to same memory space i.e GLOBAL SPACE. **This happens only for var**

### Instead of "var" let us use "let"
```
//code example 6

let b = 100; //pehlaB
{
    var a = 10;
    let b = 20; //dusraB
    const c = 30;
    console.log(b);
}

console.log(b);
```
Outputs:

> 20  // here dusraB of value 20 (present in Block) is shadowing pehlaB of value 100 (present in Script)

> 100  // this was what we were expecting in this first place. Both b's are in separate spaces (one in Block(20) and one in Script(another arbitrary mem space)(100))

* In the Scope, we have b in two places. The b outside of the block is in *Script* SCOPE (seperate memory space for let and const)
* The b inside the block is in *Block* scope.
* Thus, when in Block scope, 20 is printed and 100 when outside.
* This concept is called "Shadowing".
* It is also true for *const* declarations.

### Even "const"  behaves same as "let" in example 6
```
//code example 7

const c = 100; //pehlaC
{
    var a = 10;
    let b = 20; 
    const c = 30; //dusraC
    console.log(c);
}

console.log(c);
```
Outputs:

> 30  // here dusraC of value 30 (present in Block) is shadowing pehlaC of value 100 (present in Script) 

> 100  // Both c's are in separate spaces (one in Block(30) and one in Script(another arbitrary mem space)(100))

### Same logic is true even for functions
Shadowing is not only a concept og block, shadowing behaves the same way or has same logic even in the case of function also
```
//so even if instead of block {..} we have a function scope function x() {..} the shadowing behaves in a similar way as in the case of block {..}

const c = 100; //pehlaC
function x() {
  const c = 10; //dusraC
  console.log(c);
}
x();
console.log(c);

```
Output:
> 10 

> 100

### __What is Illegal Shadowing?__

```
// code example 8 (below is let example but const also behaves same as let)

let a = 20; 

//function x()
{
    var a = 20;
}

```

Outputs:

> Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'a' has already been declared

* We cannot shadow let with var, this is illegal shadowing. 
* However, we can shadow var with let.
* Also as we know it is valid to shadow a let using a let, it is valid to shadow a var using a var.
* ***var is function scoped*** &&& ***let and const are block scoped***
* Since var is function scoped, it is not a problem with the code below.

```
// code example 9

let a = 20;
function x() {
    var a = 20;
}
```
### Lexical Block Scope
If JS engine does not find variable value in block (in block where we are trying to print using console.log) then it searches for that variable value in the parent block and if it still does not find the variable value there then it again searches in its parent (grandparent XD) and so on......   <br /> 
Hence, Lexical Scope works in the same way inside the block also.

```
// code example 10

const a = 20;
{
  //const a = 99;
  {
    //const a = 200;
    console.log(a);
  }
  
}
```
------------
* All scope rules that work in function are same in arrow functions also. 
```
//Arrow Function of function x()

const x = () => {
  var a = 20;
};
```
